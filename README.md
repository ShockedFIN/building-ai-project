# Lifelike AI to FIFA game characters

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The basic idea is to gather player data from real life football / soccer games and use that data to create simulated characters to Fifa video game.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? 
 - My idea aims to make AI of game characters better and more realistic
 - It also aims to make game characters behave more like their real life counterparts

How common or frequent is this problem? 
 - The game character AI is pretty decent nowadays, but it mostly relies on series of rules
 - What if the game character AI could behave almost exactly like real players?
 - Could the game characters predict real football games if the player AI model was good enough?
 - Could the AI model be used to solve other game character AI problems aswell?


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. 
 - The AI model would be used to generate lifelike behaviour to game characters

Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
 - The users of the AI model would be game developers
 - The developers would have to understand how to use a trained AI model to simulate game character behaviour in different situations


## Data sources and AI methods

Where does your data come from? 
 - The data for the AI model could come from football leagues
 - The players could have positioning tags which would produce ton of positioning data
 - The positioning data would have to be refined into more useful data, for example:
    - Player speed and acceleration
    - Player distance to other players
    - Player distance to ball
    - Player movement with and without ball
 - The refined data could then be refined into behaviour models

## Challenges

Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
 - If we pretend that the AI model becomes really good at predicting the outcomes of real life games, it could prove to be a problem for gambling industry

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? 
 - The complete AI model could be used to train characters in other games and game types aswell
 - If the AI model is accurate enough, it could be used to predict the outcome of real matches

What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
 - If I were to start working on such a project I would need...
    - A large team comprised of AI and football experts
    - Huge amounts of usable data from football matches
    - Access to and expertice on game engine to simulate the accuracy of the AI model
